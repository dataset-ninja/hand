### What does content mean?

We mean the images and videos which are curated by the Visual Geometry Group (VGG), and which we are making available to you to download from a link provided by the University hosting and managing the content (or in any other way we decide).

You may download the content again, and renew the licence, if it is still available.

- use the content other than for the Permitted Purpose in strict conformity with these terms and any other reasonable instructions of the University.
- except as may be strictly necessary for carrying out the Permitted Purpose, provide or otherwise make available content to any third party or allow use of it or them by or on behalf of any third party, in whole or in part, whether by way of sale, resale, loan, transfer, hire or any other form of exploitation; or
- attempt to identify any living or deceased individual from the content.

### You shall:

- comply with all applicable laws and regulations in relation to the use of the content, including without limitation the Data Protection Act 2018 and the UK GDPR; and
